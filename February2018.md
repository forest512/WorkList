### 2018. 1. 26 - 2018. 2. 05
#### previous plans
- [ ] Validate the current case's results.
- [x] Figure out the another factors which influences the fixed particles.
      Have no idea about it.
- [x] Jamming case sets up. 

#### Current work in this week
- [x] Setting up the jamming case with initial fully developed fluid field (parabolic distribution) 
- [x] Running the different cases of jamming with different concentration.

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Validate the pressure drop.
- [ ] Debug cases to run successfully. 
- [ ] Run every case in Sun's dirs.

### 2018. 2. 06 - 2018. 2. 12
#### Previous plans which are executed and not
- [x] Validate the pressure drop successfully
- [x] Run just some cases (not every) in Sun's dirs.
- [ ] Debug cases to run successfully. 

#### Extra work beyond the plan
- [x] Convergence and Mesh independence study. 
- [x] In the new meshes, run different cases of jamming with different initial concentration.

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Debug cases with focus on the diffusion setup.
- [ ] Understand the k and nut set up in openFoam and give a correct value of them in the jamming case.
- [ ] Attend turbulence modelling and simulation class.
- [ ] Run more cases in Sun's dirs.
