### 2017. 11. 27 - 2017. 12. 1
#### Current work
* Run three serials of silt sedimentation case. The setup is detailed in file intro-testSerials.txt in server a404.
* Perpare the AGU poster.
* Read Van del Waals force between macroscopic objects (particles) and the source code fix_cohesive* in sediFoam.

#### To do in the next work
* Postprocess the data of silt sedimentation.
* Make the poster for AGU fall meeting. 

### 2017. 12. 2 - 2017. 12. 8
#### Current work
- [x] Revise the post-processing code for the silt sedimentation code, e.g.,force chain, contact stress.
- [x] Make the AGU poster

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Attend the AGU meeting
- [ ] Discuss the postprocessing of the irregular-particle dune with Rui

### 2017. 12. 9 - 2017. 12. 16
#### Current work
- [x] Attend the AGU meeting, the notes are recorded in Evernote <Notebook:AGUmeeting>.
- [x] Discuss with Rui, the postprocessing of the "irregular-particle dune" case will be going on. 
- [x] Talk with Dr. sun about the proceeding of the cohesive case (validation and inovation), see evernoteï¼šCohesive Particle Case Proceeding. 

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Postprocess the irregular-particle dune 
- [ ] Visit Dr. strom's lab, try to find the experimental results about the flocculation to validate the simulation. Is there some chance to cooperate? 
- [ ] Make the slides of learning openFoam.

### 2017. 12. 17 - 2017. 12. 22
#### Current work
- [x] Visit Dr. strom's lab, talk with Duc about the flocculation and write a report about the flocculation.
- [x] Check the case in Rui's external hard drive about the irregular dune.  
- [ ] Do not make the slides of learning openFoam.ðŸ˜­

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Have a holiday travel.
