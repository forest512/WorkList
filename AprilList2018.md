## Record and To do list in April, 2018
> It's time to have a schedule every week and do something which are really important for me. Fighting!!!
> There are some notes: 1. Make a plan which is specific and reasonable. 2. Before doing it, have a careful thinking of it. 

### 2018. 04. 02 - 2018. 04. 07
#### previous plans
- [x] Run the cases at different fluid velocity, different concentration, different orifice-particel size ratio.
- [x] Try to find the dimensionless variable about the jamming problem.

### 2018. 04. 09 - 2018. 04. 14 
#### Previous plans which are executed and not
- [x] Have look at the openFoam code about particle. (see src/lagrangian/basic/particle)
- [x] revise the sediFoam code about outputing the information of particles. 
- [x] write a matlab script to calculting the number of particles which have charged before jamming. (see jammingU2Dia16/Con015_3/CalculteJamP)

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Have a look at all of the jamming cases. Delete the useless cases and copy the important jamming cases.
- [ ] Analyze the influence of the fluid velocity and the concentration. 
- [ ] Write the Sec. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 of the draft. 
- [ ] Start running the cases about the poly-dispersity.
