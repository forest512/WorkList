#### Current work
- [x] Employed the delete particle option in sediFoam, try to finger out the add particle option.
- [x] Jamming cases updated in github (private).
- [x] Talked with Dr. strom about the flocculation formed in the shear flow.

#### To do in the next work
- [ ] Validate the current case's results.
- [ ] Jamming case sets up. 

### 2018. 1. 19 - 2018. 1. 26
#### Current work
- [x] Test the difference between the cases with cyclic BC and the inlet/outlet BC.
- [x] Revise the codes in sediFoam to decrease the influence of the fixed particles (cancel the drag force and the solid concentration fiels).
- [x] Generate the less particles with python script.
- [x] Audit the CFD class of ME dep.

#### To do in the next work
